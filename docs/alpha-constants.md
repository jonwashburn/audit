### Fine-Structure Constant Closure (Draft)

Chain
- Geometric seed: 4π × 11 (3+8 degrees in a complete 3+1 recognition)
- Ledger-gap series correction f_gap from undecidability series
- Curvature closure via Regge hinges (e.g., 16 seams → integers 102/103; normalization 2π^5)

Status
- Provide combinatorial proofs or quarantine as conjecture boxes with clear dependencies
- Ensure no tuning: integers must follow from fixed voxel identifications and seed normalization

Next steps
- Formalize seam counting and hinge curvature on T^3 voxel; prove uniqueness of (102,103) and 2π^5 factor
- Cross-check against α without reweighting
