# Recognition Science — Audit Repository

This repository hosts the live, referee‑ready audit of Recognition Science (RS):

- docs/Recognition-Science-Study-Guide.md: architecture, proofs, loose‑ends tracker, ILG kernel details, LNAL minimality draft
- papers/snapshot-charged-lepton-masses-v9.tex: parameter‑free charged‑lepton snapshot (v9)
- assets/: diagrams and figures

## Goals
- Convert all core RS claims into uniqueness/minimality theorems, and clearly mark any conditional elements
- Demonstrate cross‑domain over‑constraint (same gap series, gating, and φ‑scaling across domains)
- Provide open, incremental updates suitable for public review

## Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome for: formal proofs, corrections, and reproducibility artifacts.

## License
TBD
